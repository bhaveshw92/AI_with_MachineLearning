**Lab: Deep Learning - Linear Regression in Python**

## Part 1: Linear Regression in Python

1. **Search for Dataset:**
   - Explored the web for a dataset with one dependent and one independent variable, emphasizing linearity in a chosen field (e.g., Finance, Gaming, Healthcare, IoT, Robotics, Retail).
   - Utilized platforms like Kaggle.com using relevant search phrases such as "Linear regression" to discover suitable datasets.

2. **Download Dataset:**
   - Downloaded the chosen dataset to the local PC for further analysis.

3. **Importing the Dataset:**
   - Created a markdown cell titled "Importing the dataset" in the notebook.
   - Developed a code cell to import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, following the demonstration provided in class.

4. **Visualizing the Dataset:**
   - Employed data visualization techniques to confirm the presence of a linear relationship between the variables.

5. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing data using a 70:30 ratio.

6. **Visualizing Data Points:**
   - Visualized data points in both the training and testing datasets to gain insights.

7. **Linear Regression Model:**
   - Implemented a linear regression model and evaluated its performance on the testing dataset.

## Part 2: WEKA Installation

1. **Download Weka:**
   - Visited the official Weka download page and downloaded the appropriate version for the operating system (Windows/Mac OS X/Linux).

2. **Installation (For Windows):**
   - Located and double-clicked the .exe file to start the installation process.
   - Followed the on-screen instructions, accepted the terms, and completed the installation.

3. **Running Weka:**
   - Accessed Weka from the Start menu or Applications folder and launched the application.

## Part 3: Linear Regression and Weka

1. **Fit Linear Regression Model:**
   - Fitted a linear regression model to the same dataset used in Python.
   - Compared the results obtained from Python and WEKA.
