**Lab: Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**

## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

- **Definition:** Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian NBC) is a variant of the Naive Bayes Classifier that assumes the likelihood of the features to follow a Gaussian distribution.

- **Additional Assumptions:**
  - Features are continuous and normally distributed.
  - Features are conditionally independent given the class.

- **Histograms:**
  - Histograms are graphical representations of the distribution of data.
  - They provide information on the frequency or probability distribution of a dataset.

- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plots:**
  - KDE plots estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable.
  - They provide information on the underlying probability distribution of the data.

- **Verification of Normality:**
  - Verify that features are normally distributed or select features that meet the normality assumption for Gaussian NBC.

- **Plotting Histograms and KDEs:**
  - Use histograms and KDEs to assess the normality of features.
  - Create similar plots to determine the normality of features.

- **Confusion Matrix and Accuracy:**
  - Compute the confusion matrix and accuracy on the test data to evaluate the performance of the Gaussian NBC model.
