**Lab: Decision Trees and ML Hyperparameters**

## Decision Trees and ML Hyperparameters

- **Objective:** Design and evaluate Decision Tree (DT) models for regression tasks while exploring and tuning hyperparameters.

- **Dataset Selection:**
  - Choose a dataset in a field of your choice suitable for regression analysis.

- **Model Design and Evaluation:**
  - Design a DT model based on the selected dataset.
  - Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Design a second DT model using the same dataset split.
  - Choose three hyperparameters to tune and explain each selection:
    1. `max_depth`: Maximum depth of the tree. Controls the maximum number of levels in the tree.
    2. `min_samples_split`: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Prevents overfitting by controlling node splitting.
    3. `min_samples_leaf`: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Controls the size of the leaf nodes.

- **Model Comparison:**
  - Compare the performance of both models based on evaluation metrics and hyperparameter settings.
