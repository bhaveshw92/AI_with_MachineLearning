**Lab: Logistic Regression**

## Part 1: Logistic Regression

1. **Observe In-Class Demo:**
   - Reviewed the in-class demonstration of Logistic Regression.

2. **Research and Dataset Selection:**
   - Explored online repositories such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and Google Dataset Search.
   - Selected a dataset labeled for binary classification, ensuring it has a sufficient number of instances and features (minimum 200 rows).

3. **Data Exploration:**
   - Displayed the first few and last few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Determined the number of instances and features in the dataset.
   - Examined the features and determined their data types (e.g., numerical, categorical).

4. **Understanding Class Imbalance:**
   - Researched "Class Imbalance" and its significance.
   - Explored methods for mitigating class imbalance.

5. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets, explaining the approach used.

6. **Model Design and Fitting:**
   - Designed and fit a Logistic Regression model to the data.

7. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Computed evaluation metrics, discussing the ones most critical for the problem.

8. **Confusion Matrix Analysis:**
   - Computed the confusion matrix and analyzed its significance.
