**Lab: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**

## Part 1: MLR

1. **Download Dataset:**
   - Obtained the dataset (.csv) from BlackBoard for Lab 2.

2. **Read Dataset into DataFrame:**
   - Imported the dataset into a DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Explore Dataset:**
   - Visualized all independent variables against the dependent variable using a pairplot.
   - Utilized seaborn's pairplot function to generate plots.
   - Observed patterns and relationships in the data.

4. **Observations:**
   - Clearly stated observations using a markdown cell based on the visualizations.

5. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets, justifying the choice of split method and ratios.

6. **Fit MLR Model:**
   - Fitted a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to the data.

7. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Computed necessary evaluation metrics, justifying the choice.
   - Analyzed the results to determine if the model successfully predicted and generalized.

8. **Code Demonstration:**
   - Demonstrated the code execution.

## Part 2: MLR vs LR

(Note: LR and MLR using LinearRegression() are computed using closed-form methods. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be used for an iterative method.)
