## Assignment: Ethical Considerations in AI and CLV Prediction

### Ethical Considerations in AI:
- Discuss potential ethical concerns in decision-making processes in sensitive areas like finance, healthcare, or criminal justice.
- Investigate a real-world incident where the use of AI led to unintended consequences, detailing the incident, identifying where things went wrong, and suggesting preventive measures.

### CLV Prediction Task:
Scenario: You are the Chief Machine Learning engineer at an e-commerce start-up, aiming to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using customer behavior data.

#### Dataset Description:
- Captures behaviors and metrics of customers in an e-commerce environment over a year.
- Variables include Total Purchases, Number of Purchases, Average Rating, Days Since Last Purchase, Number of Returns, and CLV.

#### Tasks:
1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Loaded dataset using pandas.
   - Visualized relationships between features and target variable.
   
2. **Data Pre-processing:**
   - Split data into training and test sets (80% train, 20% test).
   
3. **Model Development:**
   - Created an MLR model using libraries and functions from the lab session.
   - Trained model on the training set.
   - Predicted CLV values on the test set.
   
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R^2 score.
   - Interpreted coefficients of the model.
   - Interpreted significance and impact of each feature on CLV based on coefficients.
   - Compared results with WEKA and provided analysis.
