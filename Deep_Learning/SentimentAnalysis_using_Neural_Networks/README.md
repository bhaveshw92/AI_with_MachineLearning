# YouTube Comments Sentiment Analysis

## Objectives
- Develop a sentiment analysis tool to automatically categorize comments as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Provide content creators with an efficient means of processing feedback without being overwhelmed.
- Enable data-driven decision-making by extracting valuable insights from audience comments.
- Improve the content creation experience by facilitating more focused interaction with viewers.
- Implement measures to protect the privacy and security of both the content creators and the commenters.

## Project Deliverables
- Project Proposal
- Presentation Slides
- Project Report
- Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file containing code implementation

## Models Used
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   - A simple neural network architecture used for sentiment analysis.
   
2. 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - CNN model specifically designed for text-based sentiment analysis tasks.
   
3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - RNN-LSTM model to capture sequential dependencies in text data for sentiment analysis.

## Data Collection
- Comments were extracted from the YouTube API.
- VEDAR model was used to obtain initial true labels for sentiment classification.

## Evaluation
- Models' accuracies were calculated based on the initial true labels provided by the VEDAR model.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the models.

## Conclusion
- The sentiment analysis tool developed using neural networks achieved satisfactory performance in categorizing comments into positive, negative, or neutral.
- By automating the comment categorization process, content creators can efficiently process feedback and make data-driven decisions.
- The implementation of measures to ensure privacy and security demonstrates a commitment to ethical considerations in AI and ML projects.
