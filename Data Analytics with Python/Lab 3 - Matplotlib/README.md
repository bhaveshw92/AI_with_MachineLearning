# Lab-3_Part_1

# Matplotlib Exercises

### Import Numpy, Panda and Matplotlib library

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Question 1
# Create a figure object called fig using plt.figure()
# Use add_axes to add an axis to the figure canvas at [0,0,1,1]. Call this new axis ax. 
# Plot (x,y) on that axes and set the labels and titles to match the plot below

## Question 2
# Create a figure object and put two axes on it, ax1 and ax2. Located at [0,0,1,1] and [0.2,0.5,.2,.2] respectively.
# plot (x,y) on both axes. And call your figure object to show it.

## Question 3
# Read the dataset Titanic, create the dataframe and read all columns.
# Plot the Age column information
# Plot all columns information 

## Question 4
# Plot the array bellow with different line and scatterplot colors.
# x = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])
# y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])

# x = np.array([2,2,8,1,15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12])
# y = np.array([100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85])

## Question 5
# Consider the x=np.arange(0,15,0.5),
# then plot (np.sin(x)), (np.sin(x+0.5)), (np.sin(x+1.0)), (np.cos(x))
# with different linestyle and linewidth.

Try to find out what important information can be obtained from visual representation data.

## Question 8

Add some text to a graph & create and plot a random linear graph
Right at the center if the graph add some text which says this is the center.
Also add grids to the graph.
