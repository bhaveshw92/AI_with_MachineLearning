# Analysis of Heart Disease using Various Risk Factors

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the risk factors associated with heart disease using a dataset containing 11 features. The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other relevant factors. Early detection and management of cardiovascular disease are crucial for individuals at high risk, and machine learning models can assist in this process.

## Problem Statement
Prediction of heart disease using machine learning models based on the available risk factors.

## Dataset Description
- Link to the dataset: Heart Disease Analysis - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/
- Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak, ST Slope
- Prediction Attribute: Heart Disease

## Statistical Plots
- Visualizations of the dataset, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, is presented to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the prediction attribute.

## Analytical/Predictive Model
- A machine learning model, such as logistic regression or decision tree, is built to predict the presence of heart disease based on the selected features.
- The model is designed to address the problem statement by accurately classifying individuals as either having or not having heart disease.

## Visualization of Results
- Visualizations of analytical and inference results is presented in the presentation and the report created to interpret the predictions made by the model.
- The conclusions drawn from the visualizations will provide insights into the risk factors contributing to heart disease.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into the risk factors associated with heart disease and develop a predictive model to aid in early detection and management. By analyzing the dataset and building a machine learning model, we aim to contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular health outcomes.
