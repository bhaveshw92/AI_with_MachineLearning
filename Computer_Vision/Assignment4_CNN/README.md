# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch for image classification tasks. The goal is to design and train a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs from the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset, named "CatDog," consists of images of cats and dogs. It is divided into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation, respectively.

## Instructions

1. **Model Design**: Utilize PyTorch to design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification.

2. **Training**: Train the CNN model using the training dataset and calculate training accuracy.

3. **Testing**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing dataset and calculate testing accuracy.

4. **Performance Visualization**: Plot the training loss versus epochs to visualize the model's training behavior. Also, plot the training and testing accuracies against epochs to analyze model performance.

5. **Target Accuracy**: Ensure that the achieved accuracy is more than 95%.

## Files Included

- `CatDog_dataset`: Folder containing the dataset with images of cats and dogs.
- `Assignment_07_Cat_Dog_Classification_CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for model implementation, training, testing, and performance visualization.
