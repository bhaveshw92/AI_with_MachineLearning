# Spatial Domain Filtering Operations

## Description

This assignment focuses on implementing various spatial domain filtering operations for image processing. Spatial domain filtering techniques are applied directly to the image pixels in the spatial domain, making them suitable for basic image manipulation tasks. Through this assignment, I have gained practical experience in adding noise to images, performing denoising using mean and Gaussian filters, removing salt and pepper noise using a median filter, implementing edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert filters, and comparing the performance of different edge detectors.


## Instructions

For the images provided, perform the following filtering operations in the spatial domain:

1. Add Noise on the images and then perform Image denoising using mean and Gaussian mean filter.
2. Add Salt and Pepper Noise on the images and remove salt and pepper noise using Median Filter.
3. Compare the performance of Laplacian with High boost filter on the provided images.
4. Perform edge detection by Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert filters.
5. Compare the performance of Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert filters with canny edge detectors.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Python script provided for the spatial domain filtering operations.
3. Run the script to perform the specified operations on the provided images.
4. Review the results and compare the performance of different filtering techniques.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, this assignment provided valuable insights into spatial domain filtering techniques for image processing. I gained hands-on experience in applying noise, denoising, and edge detection operations to images using various filters. Through experimentation and comparison, I learned about the strengths and limitations of different filtering techniques in enhancing or extracting features from images. Overall, this assignment enhanced my understanding of spatial domain filtering operations and their applications in image processing tasks.
