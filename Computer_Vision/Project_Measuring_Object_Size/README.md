# Measuring Object Size with OpenCV

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to measure the size of geometrical objects of different shapes using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The project focuses on detecting and measuring the size of objects such as triangles, squares/rectangles, pentagons, hexagons, circles, and unknown shapes present in a given image.

## Illustration (Second Scenario)

In this scenario, we will focus on finding the size of geometrical objects of different shapes, including triangles, squares/rectangles, pentagons, hexagons, circles, and unknown shapes. The objective is to detect each shape in the image and measure its size accurately.

## Instructions

1. **Image Acquisition**: Obtain the image containing the geometrical objects of interest. Ensure that the image is clear and properly captured to facilitate accurate object detection.

2. **Object Detection**: Use OpenCV to detect and identify the geometrical objects present in the image. Implement algorithms to recognize shapes such as triangles, squares/rectangles, pentagons, hexagons, circles, and unknown shapes.

3. **Size Measurement**: Once the objects are detected, measure their size using appropriate techniques. For example, measure the length of sides for polygons, diameter for circles, and any other relevant parameters.

4. **Display Results**: Display the detected objects along with their respective sizes. Visualize the results using graphical representations if necessary.

5. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation of the project, including the approach used for object detection, size measurement techniques, and any challenges faced during implementation.

## Files Included

- `object_size_measurement.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for object detection and size measurement using OpenCV.
- `sample_image.jpg`: Sample image containing geometrical objects for testing the code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project, instructions, and guidelines for implementation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of OpenCV for measuring the size of geometrical objects in a given image. By implementing object detection algorithms and size measurement techniques, we can accurately determine the size of various shapes present in the image. This project enhances our understanding of computer vision techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
