# Computer Vision Assignment

## Description

This assignment focuses on performing basic image processing operations using NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. Through this assignment, I will learned how to read and manipulate images, extract information such as dimensions and pixel values, convert images to grayscale, perform flipping, and extract color channels. These fundamental operations are essential in computer vision tasks and serve as the foundation for more advanced image processing techniques.


## Instructions

Perform the following operations on the images provided using NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV:

1. Read the image using OpenCV and display the image using Matplotlib.
2. Check the data type of the image.
3. Check the dimensions of the image.
4. Find the maximum and minimum values of pixels.
5. Convert the image into float format and display the image.
6. Find the maximum and minimum values of pixels in the float format.
7. Convert the image into grayscale using OpenCV and display the image with proper mapping.
8. Read the image directly in grayscale format using OpenCV.
9. Use NumPy indexing to extract the central 100 x 100 pixels of the image and display the image with size 100 x 100.
10. Perform Horizontal and Vertical Flipping of the Image.
11. Extract the Red, Green, and Blue Channel of the Image.
12. Regenerate the image from the Red, Green, and Blue Channel.
13. Submit only the PDF version of your Python script of your assignment.
14. Only the PDF version of your assignment will be accepted. Donâ€™t make a zip file and do not submit the image and assignment instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Python script provided for the assignment.
3. Run the script and generate the output.
4. Save the script as a PDF file using the preferred method (e.g., print to PDF).
5. Submit the PDF version of the script as the assignment submission.


## Conclusion

Through this assignment, I gained practical experience in working with images using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. I learned how to read and visualize images, manipulate pixel values, and perform common image processing tasks. This assignment enhanced my understanding of basic computer vision concepts and provided hands-on experience in implementing them. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my skills in image processing and computer vision.
