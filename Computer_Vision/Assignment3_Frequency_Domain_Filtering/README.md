# Frequency Domain Filtering and Thresholding Operations

## Description

This assignment focuses on implementing frequency domain filtering and thresholding operations for image processing. In the first part of the assignment, students will learn how to perform low pass and high pass filtering in the frequency domain. They will explore the steps involved in coding these operations, including transforming the images to the frequency domain, applying filters, and transforming back to the spatial domain. Additionally, students will display the frequency domain version of the low pass and high pass filters.

In the second part of the assignment, students will delve into binary and adaptive thresholding techniques to improve the visibility of text in an image. They will utilize the cv2.threshold() and cv2.adaptiveThreshold() functions provided by OpenCV. Through this exercise, students will gain practical experience in thresholding techniques and learn how to apply them to enhance image visibility and extract important features.

## Instructions

1. For the images provided, perform the low pass and high pass filtering operations in frequency domain. Show all the steps during coding. Also display the frequency domain version of low pass and high pass filters.
2. In the second part of the assignment, students will learn how to perform binary and adaptive thresholding to improve the visibility of text in image Text.png. For thresholding you will explore cv2.threshold() and cv2.adaptiveThreshold() functions of OpenCV.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Python script provided for the frequency domain filtering and thresholding operations.
3. Run the script to perform the specified operations on the provided images.
4. Review the results and observe the steps involved in coding each operation.
5. Compare the original images with the processed images to evaluate the effectiveness of the filtering and thresholding techniques.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, this assignment provided valuable insights into frequency domain filtering and thresholding techniques for image processing. I gained hands-on experience in implementing low pass and high pass filtering operations in the frequency domain, as well as binary and adaptive thresholding techniques in the spatial domain. Through experimentation and observation of the results, I learned about the effects of different filtering and thresholding parameters on image quality and visibility. Overall, this assignment enhanced my understanding of advanced image processing techniques and their applications in various real-world scenarios.
