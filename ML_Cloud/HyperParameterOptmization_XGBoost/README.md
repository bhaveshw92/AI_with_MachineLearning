### Assignment: Analyzing Hyperparameter Optimization Results

#### Objective
This assignment involves analyzing the results of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using the HPO_xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker_APIs notebook. The notebook leverages Bayesian search for optimizing hyperparameters.

#### Background

Direct marketing, whether through mail, email, phone calls, or other channels, is a common strategy for customer acquisition. However, due to limited resources and the finite attention of customers, it's essential to target only those prospects who are most likely to engage with a specific offer. Predicting these potential customers based on available information such as demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a typical machine learning problem.

This notebook focuses on training a model to predict whether a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank after one or more phone calls. Hyperparameter tuning will be employed to explore multiple hyperparameter settings and identify the best-performing model.

#### Preparation

Before proceeding, it's necessary to specify:

- The S3 bucket and prefix to be used for training and model data. Ensure that this is located in the same region as SageMaker training.
- The IAM role, which grants training access to your data. Refer to SageMaker documentation for instructions on creating IAM roles.

#### Steps
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Run the notebook in the myapps environment.
   - Run the notebook in the us-east-1 region.

2. **Notebook Execution:**
   - Execute the HPO-hpo_xgboost_direct_marketing_sagemaker_APIs notebook.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Review the "Analyze the correlation between objective metric and individual hyperparameters" section.
   - Add analysis (hypotheses) to the notebook regarding potential improvements in hyperparameter values for future training jobs.
   
4. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Create a new training job (non-HPO) with the hypothesized better hyperparameters.
   - Analyze the performance of the new training job to validate the hypotheses.

#### Overview

7. **Analyze Correlation Between Objective Metric and Hyperparameters:** Understand the relationship between objective metric and individual hyperparameters.
8. **Deploy the Best Model:** Deploy the top-performing model for inference.
9. **Observations:** Summarize insights gained from the project.

#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of XGBoost and hyperparameter tuning in solving a binary prediction problem. By optimizing hyperparameters, we can improve model performance and make more accurate predictions in direct marketing scenarios.
