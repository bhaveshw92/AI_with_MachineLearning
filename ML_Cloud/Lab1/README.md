# Cloud Machine Learning Lab

## Demo: AWS S3 Bucket Creation and Listing

### Step 1: Create a Bucket and Load the Humber Logo

1. Create a new S3 bucket named "my-new-bucket".
2. Upload the Humber logo to the bucket.

### Step 2: Use AWS CLI to Create a Bucket

### Step 3: Run Python Function to List Bucket Names (listbuckets.py)

### Step 4: Querying S3 Bucket Names and Running Instances Programmatically
Steps:
- Create a new EC2 instance in a public subnet.
- Install boto3 library on the EC2 instance.
- Query and show S3 bucket names and running instances programmatically from inside the EC2 instance.
- Ensure the EC2 instance has the necessary IAM role (Lab role) assigned.

Note:
- Ensure that proper IAM roles and permissions are configured to access S3 buckets and EC2 instances programmatically.


This README provides instructions for the Cloud Machine Learning Lab, including a demo of AWS S3 bucket creation and listing using AWS CLI and Python. It also outlines the lab tasks for querying S3 bucket names and running instances programmatically from within an EC2 instance. Make sure to follow the steps carefully and ensure proper IAM role assignment for access permissions.
