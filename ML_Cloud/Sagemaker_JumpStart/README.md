## Steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Create an S3 bucket and organize folders for train, validation, and test datasets.
   - Place the respective data.csv files into their designated folders.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Access SageMaker and choose the XGBoost Classification Model from JumpStart.
   - Specify the dataset for predicting strokes in the health dataset.

3. **Training Job Execution:**
   - Configure the model and initiate the training job.
   - Monitor the job status in the SageMaker Training tab and ensure successful completion.

4. **Endpoint Creation:**
   - Configure the endpoint for the trained model.
   - Confirm the creation of the endpoint.

5. **Model Inference:**
   - Invoke the created endpoint to predict the test data.
   - Analyze and interpret the predicted results, providing feedback on the accuracy.

6. **Observations and Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the predicted accuracy of the model (e.g., 0.92).
   - Provide insights and implications based on the model's performance.
