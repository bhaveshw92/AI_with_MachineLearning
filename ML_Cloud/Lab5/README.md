# Lab: Data Wrangler in AWS Sagemaker

## Assignment Description:

1. Visit [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to select a dataset for analysis.
2. Analyze the selected dataset in DataWrangler (DW) to identify opportunities for improving data quality (e.g., removing missing values, scaling data, one-hot encoding, etc.).
3. Clean and transform the data using DataWrangler.
4. Upload the following items to Blackboard (BB):
   - Selected dataset
   - DW .flow file (to learn how to download the .flow file, see instructions provided)
   - Report covering the suggested Table of Contents (ToC) outlined below.

## ToC for the Report:

1. Data Set Fields Descriptions:
   - Provide descriptions of the fields/features in the dataset.

2. Visualization and Analysis:
   - Present visualizations and analysis conducted in DW.
   - Include screenshots of each analysis along with descriptions.

3. Data Transformations:
   - Explain the transformations applied and reasons for selecting them.
   - Include screenshots of the results after transformation with descriptions.

4. Code (if applicable):
   - Include any code used in the analysis or transformations within the report.

## Implementation:

1. Dataset Selection:
   - Chose the "Stroke Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle.
   - Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

2. Data Analysis in DW:
   - Explored the dataset in DataWrangler to identify missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
   - Removed missing values, scaled data, and performed one-hot encoding as necessary.
   - Explained the rationale behind each transformation and provided screenshots of the transformed data.

4. Report Generation:
   - Created a comprehensive report covering the ToC requirements.
   - Included descriptive analysis, visualizations, transformation details, and any associated code snippets.

## Conclusion:
   - Demonstrated proficiency in data cleaning and transformation techniques using DataWrangler.
   - Provided insights into the selected dataset and addressed potential data quality issues effectively.
