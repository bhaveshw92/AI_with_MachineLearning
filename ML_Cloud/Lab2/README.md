# Lab 2.1: AWS Lambda Function for S3 Event Handling

## Assignment: Handling S3 Put Events with Lambda Function

### Task Description:

1. Create a dummy Lambda function with Python 3.9 runtime.
2. Assign the LabRole to the Lambda function.
3. Configure a test event using the S3Put template to simulate an S3 Put event.
4. Review the JSON event data passed from S3 to Lambda during a Put event.
5. Write a Lambda function in Python to print the bucket name and object name when an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
6. Learn how to create an S3 event trigger to invoke the Lambda function.
7. Modify the Lambda function code to handle S3 Put events and extract relevant information from the event payload.

# Lab 2.2: SageMaker Model Creation

### Steps to Create a SageMaker Model:

1. Use the `model.tar.gz` model artifact file generated by the previous training job.
2. Modify the provided `model.py` skeleton code to create a SageMaker model.
3. Ensure that the code is properly configured to load the trained model from the artifact file.
4. Run the modified `model.py` script to create the SageMaker model.

### Provided Files:

- `model.tar.gz`: Model artifact file generated by the training job.
- `model.py`: Code to use as a starting point for creating the SageMaker model. Load the trained model from the artifact file.

## Optional: Deploying the Model

### Deployment Using `create_endpoint.py` (Optional)

- Use the provided `create_endpoint.py` skeleton code to deploy the model.
- Modify the code as necessary to configure the endpoint settings and deploy the model to a SageMaker endpoint.

### Note:

- Ensure that you have necessary permissions and access to AWS resources to create and deploy SageMaker models.
- Test the deployed model endpoint to verify its functionality and performance.
