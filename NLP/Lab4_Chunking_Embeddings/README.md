## 4. Lecture_4_Chunking_Embeddings.pdf

### Overview

This lecture covers important topics like chunking, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, and vector semantics. It also introduces different word embedding techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and TF-IDF.

### Key Topics

- **Chunking**: Identifying non-overlapping segments of sentences (e.g., noun phrases).
- **NER**: Recognizing named entities in text and assigning correct labels.
- **Vector Semantics**: Learning word embeddings from large corpora.
- **Word Embeddings**: Overview of Word2Vec, GloVe, and TF-IDF techniques for text representation.

### How to Use

Read `Lecture_4_Chunking_Embeddings.pdf` for a comprehensive theoretical background on chunking, NER, and word embeddings.
