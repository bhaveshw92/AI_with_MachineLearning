Early one morning Nilkanth sat under a banyan tree to perform 
his morning puja. At that time the king of Vanshipur who was 
out hunting‚ came there and saw the young Brahmachari. The 
resplendent face of the young tapasvi impressed the ruler as 
something out of the ordinary. The was an ardent seeker of 
liberation and in Varni he recognized at once his spiritual guide. 
He was overjoyed and thought to himself‚ “Today Narayan has 
16 Nilkanth Charitra
come in person to liberate me.” At once he sought refuge at the 
young Brahmachari’s feet. When Nilkanth opened his eyes he saw 
the king before him. He entreated Nilkanth to come to his palace 
and liberate him and his family. When he saw the sincerity in the 
ruler’s request‚ the young celibate agreed to go with him. The king 
helped him sit on his royal horse‚ got hold of the reins and galloped 
to his city. On reaching his city his citizens thronged to both sides 
of the road to see their king leading a young Brahmachari to his 
palace. He received reverential salutation all along the route. 
Finally Nilkanth entered the darbar where the queen briskly and 
enthusiastically ran to receive the new guest. Everyone felt that 
the young Brahmachari was not an ordinary guest but God himself.
The royal couple were wanting in one thing. They did not have 
a male heir. They had two daughters‚ Ila and Sushila. They too 
were impressed by Nilkanth’s illustrious personality. From that 
day onwards till he left the palace‚ Nilkanth was served devoutly 
by the king‚ queen‚ and their two daughters. The princesses would 
arrange puja materials for the Brahmachari. Fruits‚ flowers and 
water would be brought everyday by Sushila and Ila. Nilkanth 
would offer it to Thakorji. He used to eat very little himself and 
distribute the rest as prasad.
Varni would sometimes talk of his own life and sometimes about 
the past and the future. Everybody would listen to him with rapt 
attention. But the queen had some personal interest in keeping 
Varni in her kingdom.
One day she came to Nilkanth and said‚ “Brahmachariji! We 
would like to give this kingdom to you. Along with that we would 
give you our daughters in marriage. Therefore give up the bother of 
going to the forest to do austerities.” Varni laughed at the worldly 
inclinations displayed by the queen and said‚ “Mother! I have still 
to wander the forests and liberate souls like you. I have come here 
as a result of your austerities. You are very fortunate (in having me 
here).” The queen was greatly distressed and agitated on hearing 
Nilkanth in Vanshipur 17
this reply. “Brahmachari! Think carefully. You are a mere boy now. 
When you become a young man you will become restless without 
a woman? Kamdev has overcome great minds. Do you think he 
will leave you alone?”
Varni took pity on the queen and said‚ “My joy lies in going to 
the forest and meditating on Paramatma.” The queen felt as if the 
ground was slipping from under her feet. “Is Varni going to leave 
us?” was the thought that worried her most. She made one last 
attempt to frighten Nilkanth by vividly describing the dangers of 
the forest. To this Varni had a ready answer: “Mother‚ I am not 
afraid of the forest‚ its ferocious creatures or the extremes of heat 
and cold. One should be afraid of worldly pleasures. I have come 
to this world to liberate people from the allurement of maya and 
take them to my Akshardham. I have not come to become attached 
to your kingdom or your daughters. However‚ since all of you have 
served me with devotion I shall grant you all Akshardham.”
The veil of illusion was lifted from the queen’s mind. She went 
into a divine trance. Nilkanth left the room. When she awoke from 
the trance she was weeping. Her daughters advised her‚ “Mother 
we have in our midst a divine person who is pure and above 
mundane desires. Let us serve him according to his wishes. Do 
not be stubborn in your ways. Be insistent in keeping him within 
your heart and give up your mundane motives.” These words were 
like nectar to the queen. Then Sushila and Ila rushed to Nilkanth’s 
room. There they found him sitting in swastik-asan and in deep 
meditation. They had his darshan‚ came on tiptoe and made his 
bed. They also filled his gourd with fresh water‚ brought some 
fruits and flowers and quietly left the room.
Nilkanth sat in meditation for a long time. He lost count of 
time. It was late night. The palace gate was closed. Varni opened 
his eyes and thought that he should leave the place because the 
royal family‚ out of their faith in him‚ would definitely be liberated. 
And with this resolve he left the palace in a flash. 
18 Nilkanth Charitra
The next morning when Sushila and Ila went to Nilkanth’s 
room‚ they found it empty. They felt that he must have left the 
palace. The weeping princesses rushed to their mother to convey 
the news. The queen could not bear the terrible news and thus 
collapsed on the floor. The king was informed and soon the tragic 
news spread to different parts of the capital and the kingdom. 
People thronged to the palace to verify the report. There were 
scenes of mourning in the palace. The king ordered horse riders to 
fan out in different directions to search for Nilkanth. “Don’t return 
without bringing the young Brahmachari‚” was the royal edict.
The mounted riders fanned out far and wide but found no trace 
of Nilkanth. The king himself went in search of Nilkanth but could 
not find any trace of him. He returned sorely distressed. Nilkanth 
assured the king through his uttering from the sky that he would 
be able to meet him later in Saurashtra.
