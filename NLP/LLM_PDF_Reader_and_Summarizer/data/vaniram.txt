GIVES DARSHAN TO VENIRAM AND 
REVIVES RAGHUNANDAN

Meanwhile‚ in Ayodhya‚ Ghanshyam’s renunciation had 
plunged the city into grief and sadness. Thinking that Ghanshyam 
might have gone to Chhapaiya‚ Rampratapbhai went there and 
searched for him for seven days‚ but to no avail. Even the friends 
of Ghanshyam searched for him until they too got tired. Suddenly‚ 
Veniram remembered that Ghanshyam often jumped into the deep 
well of the village. He said to himself‚ “Let me go and look in the 
well. If Ghanshyam is not to be found there‚ I shall also kill myself 
by drowning in the well.”
Having thought thus‚ Veniram plunged into the well but could 
not find Ghanshyam. When Veniram did not come out even after 
an hour‚ his father‚ Motiram‚ got worried and he too jumped into 
the well to save his son. The well was very deep and dark. Motiram 
began to drown in the well. As time passed neither father or son 
came out of the well. Veniram’s mother and maternal uncle also 
went there and began to cry and beat their chests in despair.
Ghanshyam took pity on them and thus appeared in the well 
in his divine form. At once‚ the well was flooded with divine light. 
Gently he lifted Veniram and his father out of the well‚ and then 
disappeared into the sky. Veniram was overjoyed at this good 
fortune of having had the darshan of Ghanshyam.
Ghanshyam had another close friend‚ Raghunandan‚ who was 
the son of a Bania. He too searched for Ghanshyam for seven 
days‚ but when he could not find him‚ he became very dejected 
and thought‚ “What joy is left for me in life without Ghanshyam?”
Thinking thus‚ Raghunandan went to the Narayan lake‚ and 
sitting under a mango tree began to meditate on Ghanshyam. So 
great was his grief that he could no longer bear it and he died 
during his meditation. 
As Raghunandan did not return home till late evening‚ his 
parents became worried. With the assistance of Rampratapbhai 
they began to search for their son. Rampratapbhai‚ who was 
already deeply anguished at Ghanshyam’s departure‚ became all 
the more unhappy at the disappearance of Raghunandan.
They all set out for Narayan lake in search of Raghunandan. 
Seeing the grief of these three persons‚ Hanumanji appeared in 
the sky and informed Rampratapbhai in a heavenly voice‚ “Your 
younger brother has gone to the forest to perform austerities. After 
that he will establish his own Fellowship on earth for the moral and 
spiritual regeneration of mankind. Then he will send for you and 
give his darshan. Therefore please do not lament over his absence 
any more.” On hearing this‚ Rampratapbhai was greatly relieved.
Continuing their search for Raghunandan‚ they came to a mango 
tree. There they found Raghunandan’s dead body. His parents began 
to sob bitterly. Seeing their anguish‚ Ghanshyam came down from 
the sky in a divine form and brought Raghunandan back to life. 
He made him sit up and said‚ “I have not left you. I shall give you 
my darshan whenever you remember me. But don’t abandon your 
life like this.” Thus‚ Ghanshyam gave darshan to Raghunandan‚ his 
parents and Rampratapbhai in his divine form and then disappeared.
Proceeding further‚ Nilkanth reached Lodheshwar‚ where 
there is a mandir called Lodheshwar Mahadev and a lake of the 
same name. Nilkanth bathed in the lake and had the darshan of 
Mahadev. After a night at the mandir‚ he continued his journey and
passing through Jetpur and Pathepur‚ he came to Naimisharanya 
(Kherilapur).
There is a lake in Naimisharanya called Chakratirth around 
which there are many mandirs. After visiting all the sacred places 
in Naimisharanya‚ where thousands of years ago Sutji had recited 
the Shrimad Bhagvat before Shaunak and other sages‚ Nilkanth 
proceeded further towards the north.
After passing through Sahejapur and Bareli on the way‚ he
entered a dense forest. The way ahead was very difficult. The 
forest was so thick that it remained completely dark even during 
the day. It abounded in dense bushes and numerous wild animals 
like lions‚ tigers‚ leopards‚ wolves‚ jackals‚ hyenas and elephants. 
It was infested with snakes‚ crabs‚ wild owls and scorpions. One 
had to walk over heaps of dry leaves. The area was so isolated and 
fearful that one would tremble to death on hearing the thundering 
roars of the wild beasts. But Nilkanth walked on through this dark 
and terrifying forest‚ undaunted and unperturbed.
