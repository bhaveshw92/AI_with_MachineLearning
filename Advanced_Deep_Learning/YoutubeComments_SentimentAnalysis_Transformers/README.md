# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

## Goal
The project aims to conduct sentiment analysis on YouTube comments to assist content creators in understanding audience sentiment effectively. By leveraging Hugging Face models, the goal is to implement these models in NLP tasks and create solutions for identified problems.

## Objective
1. Develop a preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare the YouTube comment data.
2. Implement a sentiment analysis model using transformer DistilBertForSequenceClassification.
3. Train the model to accurately classify sentiment in YouTube comments.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and deploy it for real-time sentiment analysis on YouTube comments.

## Libraries and Resources
### Libraries
- Hugging Face Transformers: For implementing NLP models like DistilBERT for sentiment analysis.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and sentiment analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For model evaluation and metrics.

### Dataset
- YouTube Comment Dataset: The dataset was collected via the YouTube API, consisting of comments from various videos for sentiment analysis.
