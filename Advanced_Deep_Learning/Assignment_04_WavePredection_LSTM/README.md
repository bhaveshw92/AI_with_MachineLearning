# Assignment 04: LSTM for Time Series Prediction and Classification

This repository contains code for designing LSTM models to perform time series prediction and classification tasks using two provided datasets.

## Datasets

### Spike Dataset
The Spike dataset consists of time series data. The LSTM model is designed to predict the future values of the time series after learning the signal in the dataset.

### Heterogeneous_accelerometer_HAR Dataset
The Heterogeneous_accelerometer_HAR dataset contains sensor data, which is a time series data representing six different human actions. The LSTM model is designed to classify the data into the labels provided in the dataset.

## Instructions

1. Read the Spike dataset and design an LSTM model for time series prediction.
2. Read the Heterogeneous_accelerometer_HAR dataset and design an LSTM model for classification.
3. Evaluate the performance of both models.
4. Submit only the Python script / file of your code in the running / executing form.

## Results
The scripts will train the LSTM models, evaluate their performance, and display the results.
