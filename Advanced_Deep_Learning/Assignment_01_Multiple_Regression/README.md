# Multiple Regression with PyTorch and TensorFlow

This repository contains code for performing multiple regression using PyTorch and TensorFlow on the "Ecommerce Customers_Kaggle" dataset obtained from Kaggle.com.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of several features such as 'Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership', and the target variable 'Yearly Amount Spent'. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Instructions
1. Import the dataset using Pandas.
2. Preprocess the data and select the relevant features for prediction.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
5. Define and train a PyTorch model for multiple regression.
6. Define and train a TensorFlow model for multiple regression.
7. Evaluate the performance of both models using RMSE, MAE, and R^2 score.
8. Compare the performance of the PyTorch and TensorFlow models.


## Results
The evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R^2 score) for both the PyTorch and TensorFlow models are calculated and the implementation is share in the ipynb file.
